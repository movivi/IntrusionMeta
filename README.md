# IntrusionMeta
This repository contains **R** scripts compiled to:
* Pre-process coding data and **compute effect sizes** (Hedges' *g*)
* Run **outlier and influential cases analysis**
* Run **three-level meta-analysis**
* Run **moderation/meta-regression analysis**
* Run **publication bias analysis**

The aforesaid analyses are performed on the topic of effectiveness of all existing experimental techniques in modulating **intrusive trauma memories** and its related outcomes (e.g. distress)
